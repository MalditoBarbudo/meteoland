Reads gridded meteorology from the disk

\description{
Functions to read gridded meteorological data from the disk.
}
\usage{
readmeteorologygrid(files, format = "netCDF", varmapping = NULL,
                    dates = NULL, bbox = NULL, offset = 0)
readmeteorologypixels(files, format = "netCDF", varmapping = NULL,
                      dates = NULL, bbox = NULL, offset = 0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{files}{Character vector with the file names to be read.}
  \item{format}{Format of meteorological data. Currently, the only accepted format is \code{"netCDF"}.}
  \item{varmapping}{Named character vector specifying a mapping of variables in the NetCDF into variables used in meteoland (e.g. \code{c(MinTemperature = "tmn")} specifies a map of variable 'tmn' to MinTemperature).}
  \item{dates}{A character or Date vector to specify subset of dates to be read.}
  \item{bbox}{Boundary box (2 x 2 matrix) specifying the minimum and maximum coordinates of a study area.}
  \item{offset}{A buffer to include NetCDF cells that are at a certain distance around the boundary box.}
}
\details{
  Function \code{readmeteorologygrid} reads one or several files containing the meteorology over a grid for a set of days. Function \code{readmeteorologypixels} reads one or several file containing the meteorology over a grid for a set of days and filters those pixels with missing data. If more than one file is specificated, the functions read all of them and then try to merge the data into a single meteorology object (see function \code{\link{mergegrids}}).
  
  The functions are primarily meant to read NetCDF written by package meteoland, but also to import data written by other software. Rotated grids cannot be read at present.
}
\value{
Function \code{readmeteorologygridfiles} returns an object \code{\link{SpatialGridMeteorology-class}}. Function \code{readmeteorologypixels} returns an object \code{\link{SpatialPixelsMeteorology-class}}.
